# Hangman

Hangman is a simple word guessing game that can be played by one or two people.

## Description

The goal of this project was to practice building a fun app using Vanilla JavaScript only, no frameworks or libraries. Players can select to play with two people or solo. For the one-player game, categories and words are preloaded in an array and randomly generated for the player to guess. For two players, the first player creates a category/word and the second player has to guess the word. Each letter guessed correctly is displayed on the page. For each incorrect guess, a body part is added to the hangman image. If the hangman image is completed before the player can guess the word, they lose the game. To guess a letter, players type it into a text input.

## Future Goals

One idea that I have is for players to guess letters using a virtual keyboard, rather than a text input. Players could click or tap each letter of the virtual keyboard, or use the physical keyboard of their computer.
Another idea is to add sound effects or music.
